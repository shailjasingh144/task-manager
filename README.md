Task Management App
Description
This is a simple task management application with separate dashboards for Managers and Employees. It allows Managers to create projects, assign tasks to employees, and track their progress. Employees can view tasks assigned to them in their dashboard.

The app uses Firebase for authentication, and Firestore for storing project and task data.

Features
Manager Dashboard: Create and manage projects, assign tasks to employees.
Employee Dashboard: View tasks assigned to the logged-in employee.
User Authentication: Firebase Authentication for signing up, logging in, and logging out.
Task Management: View tasks, filter tasks by assignee, and assign new tasks to employees.
Prerequisites
Before running the app, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/)
Firebase account (for Firestore and Authentication configuration)
Setup & Running Locally
1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/task-management-app.git
cd task-management-app
2. Install dependencies
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
or if using yarn:

bash
Copy
yarn install
3. Firebase Configuration
Make sure you have a Firebase project set up. You can do this by following the steps in the Firebase documentation.

Create a Firebase project.
Enable Firebase Authentication (Email/Password).
Enable Firestore in the Firebase console.
Once set up, get your Firebase configuration (API keys, etc.) from the Firebase Console and replace it in the firebase.js file in the src folder with your credentials.

4. Running the Application
To start the application locally, run:

bash
Copy
npm start
or if using yarn:

bash
Copy
yarn start
This will start the development server and open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

5. Access the Application
Once the app is running locally, you can:

Sign Up to create a new account.
Login using Firebase authentication to access the respective dashboards (Manager or Employee).
Deployed Application (if applicable)
If the application is deployed, you can access it via the following URL:

arduino
Copy
https://your-deployed-app-url.com
Replace your-deployed-app-url.com with the actual URL where the app is hosted.

Project Structure
src/
components/: Contains React components for different parts of the app, including dashboards and sign-up.
firebase.js: Firebase configuration file.
App.js: Main entry point for the app, setting up routes and authentication.
firestoreService.js: Service file for interacting with Firestore (projects, tasks, users).
Additional Notes
Authentication: Firebase Authentication is used for login and signup.
Firestore: Projects and tasks are stored in Firestore, and users can interact with them based on their roles (Manager or Employee).
Troubleshooting
If you're having issues with Firestore or Authentication, make sure you've properly configured Firebase and updated the credentials in firebase.js.
If you're not seeing the UI updates, try running npm run build or yarn build to create a production build.
